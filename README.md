# Next-Gen Recommender System

This repository contains the solution for the Gen-AI Hackathon, where a deep learning model is trained to predict customer categories based on transaction data.

## Directory Structure
- `dataset/`: Contains the dataset used for training.
- `model_development/`: Contains the trained model.
- `training_testing/`: Contains the Jupyter Notebook with the implementation and results.

## Steps Followed
1. Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding, scaling).
2. Model selection and training.
3. Model evaluation using accuracy and F1-score.
4. Saving the model and final notebook.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure you have the required libraries installed (`pandas`, `tensorflow`, `scikit-learn`, etc.).
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook to replicate the results.

## Results
- **Test Accuracy**: 100%
