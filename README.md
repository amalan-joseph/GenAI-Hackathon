The trained model achieves exceptional accuracy and reliability, ensuring effective predictions for real-world applications. The system has been developed using Python, TensorFlow, and essential data science libraries, making it scalable and easy to integrate into various domains.

With its ability to process transactional data and deliver actionable insights, the Next-Gen Recommender System can be applied to retail, e-commerce, and customer service sectors. This solution empowers businesses to enhance customer satisfaction, increase sales, and optimize inventory management by anticipating customer needs and preferences.
## Repository Overview

This repository contains the implementation of the **Next-Gen Recommender System**, a machine learning-based solution to analyze and recommend patterns from transactional data. The project includes the model, dataset, and code required for training and testing the recommender system.

## Implementation Details

### Tools and Environment
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - **Data Processing**: pandas, numpy
  - **Machine Learning**: scikit-learn
  - **Deep Learning**: TensorFlow, Keras
- **Development Environment**:
  - Google Colab: For leveraging GPU acceleration during training
  - Jupyter Notebook: For documentation and local development
- **Version Control**: GitHub for project collaboration and submission

### Dataset
- **Source**: `a_to_z_supermarket_transactions.csv`
- **Key Attributes**:
  - `customer_id`: Unique identifier for customers
  - `product_id`: Unique identifier for products
  - `category`: Product category (target variable)
  - `quantity`, `price`, `total_spent`: Numerical attributes describing the purchase

### Data Preprocessing
- **Objective**: Clean and transform data for training the model.
- **Steps**:
  1. **Label Encoding**: Convert categorical variables (`customer_id`, `product_id`, `category`) into numeric form.
  2. **Normalization**: Standardize numerical features (`quantity`, `price`, `total_spent`).
  3. **One-Hot Encoding**: Transform the target variable (`category`) into a multi-class binary matrix.
  4. **Train-Test Split**: Divide the data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets to evaluate the model.

### Neural Network Architecture
- **Input Layer**: Accepts six features: `customer_id`, `product_id`, `category`, `quantity`, `price`, and `total_spent`.
- **Hidden Layers**:
  - **Layer 1**: 64 neurons with ReLU activation for feature learning.
  - **Dropout 1**: 20% dropout to prevent overfitting.
  - **Layer 2**: 32 neurons with ReLU activation.
  - **Dropout 2**: 20% dropout.
- **Output Layer**: Neurons equal to the number of unique categories with a softmax activation for multi-class classification.

## Training the Model
- **Loss Function**: Categorical Crossentropy (for multi-class classification).
- **Optimizer**: Adam (adaptive learning rate).
- **Metrics**: Accuracy.
- **Epochs**: 20 epochs (can be adjusted based on validation results).
- **Batch Size**: 32 for efficient gradient computation.
- **Validation**: Monitors performance on test data during training.

## Model Evaluation
- **Metrics Used**:
  - **Accuracy**: The percentage of correct predictions.
  - **Loss**: Crossentropy loss to measure prediction errors.
  - **F1-Score**: Evaluates precision and recall balance (optional).

## Deployment
- **Model File**: The trained model is saved as `a_to_z_supermarket_model.h5` for reuse and deployment.
- **Notebook**: All steps were documented and saved as `Next-Gen Recommender System.ipynb`.
  
## Output
- **Final Deliverables**:
  - A fully trained and validated recommender system capable of predicting product categories based on customer data.
  - Performance Metrics: Test accuracy and loss values demonstrating the effectiveness of the model.
