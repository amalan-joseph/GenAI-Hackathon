## Repository Overview

This repository contains the implementation of the **Next-Gen Recommender System**, a machine learning-based solution to analyze and recommend patterns from transactional data. The project includes the model, dataset, and code required for training and testing the recommender system.

## Implementation Details : 

The project implements a Next-Gen Recommender System designed to predict 
product categories based on customer transactional data. Below are the detailed 
steps of the implementation: 
1. Tools and Environment 
• Programming Language: Python 
• Libraries: 
o Data Processing: pandas, numpy 
o Machine Learning: scikit-learn 
o Deep Learning: TensorFlow, Keras 
• Development Environment: 
o Google Colab: For leveraging GPU acceleration during training. 
o Jupyter Notebook: For documentation and local development. 
• Version Control: GitHub for project collaboration and submission. 
2. Dataset 
• Source: a_to_z_supermarket_transactions.csv 
• Key Attributes: 
o customer_id: Unique identifier for customers. 
o product_id: Unique identifier for products. 
o category: Product category (target variable). 
o quantity, price, total_spent: Numerical attributes describing the 
purchase. 
3. Data Preprocessing 
• Objective: Clean and transform data for training the model. 
• Steps: 
o Label Encoding: Convert categorical variables (customer_id, 
product_id, category) into numeric form using LabelEncoder. 
o Normalization: Standardize numerical features (quantity, price, 
total_spent) using StandardScaler to improve model performance. 
o One-Hot Encoding: Transform the target variable (category) into a 
multi-class binary matrix for classification. 
o Train-Test Split: Divide the data into training (80%) and testing 
(20%) sets to evaluate the model. 
4. Neural Network Architecture 
A custom Deep Neural Network (DNN) was designed to classify the product 
category: 
• Input Layer: 
o Accepts six features: customer_id, product_id, category, quantity, 
price, and total_spent. 
• Hidden Layers: 
o Layer 1: 64 neurons with ReLU activation for feature learning. 
o Dropout 1: 20% dropout to prevent overfitting. 
o Layer 2: 32 neurons with ReLU activation for deeper 
representation. 
o Dropout 2: 20% dropout to further reduce overfitting. 
• Output Layer: 
o Neurons equal to the number of unique categories in the dataset. 
o Softmax Activation: Outputs probabilities for multi-class 
classification. 
5. Model Training 
• Objective: Train the DNN model to classify product categories accurately. 
• Steps: 
o Loss Function: Categorical Crossentropy (suitable for multi-class 
classification). 
o Optimizer: Adam (adaptive learning rate optimization). 
o Metrics: Accuracy. 
o Epochs: 20 (can be adjusted based on validation results). 
o Batch Size: 32 for efficient gradient computation. 
o Validation: Monitor performance on testing data during training. 
6. Model Evaluation 
• Metrics Used: 
o Accuracy: The percentage of correct predictions. 
o Loss: Crossentropy loss to measure prediction errors. 
o F1-Score (Optional): Evaluates precision and recall balance. 
7. Deployment Artifacts 
• Model File: The trained model was saved as 
a_to_z_supermarket_model.h5 for reuse and deployment. 
• Notebook: All steps were documented and saved as Next-Gen 
Recommender System.ipynb. 
• GitHub Repository Structure: 
o dataset/: Contains the a_to_z_supermarket_transactions.csv. 
o model/: Includes a_to_z_supermarket_model.h5. 
o notebooks/: Contains the implementation notebook. 
o results/: Stores outputs and screenshots for reference. 
8. Output 
• Final Deliverables: 
o A fully trained and validated recommender system capable of 
predicting product categories based on customer data. 
o Performance Metrics: Test accuracy and loss values demonstrating 
the effectiveness of the model.
